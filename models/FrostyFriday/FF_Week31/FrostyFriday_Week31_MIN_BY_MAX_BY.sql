--Frosty Fridayâ€™s super academy wants to know who their best and worst super heroes are, and the only metric that matters is villains defeated. Using MIN_BY and MAX_BY, tell us which super hero is the best, and which is the worst.

SELECT 
    MAX_BY(hero_name,villains_defeated)   AS BEST_HERO,
    MIN_BY(hero_name,villains_defeated)   as WORST_HERO
